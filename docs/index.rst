Gene Feature Enumeration Service
================================

The Gene Feature Enumeration (GFE) Submission service provides an API for converting raw sequence data to GFE. 
It provides both a RESTful API and a simple user interface for converting raw sequence data to GFE results. 
Sequences can be submitted one at a time or as a fasta file. 
This service uses `feature service`_ for encoding the raw sequence data and `annotation pipeline`_ for aligning the raw sequence data. 
A public version of this service is available for use at `gfe.b12x.org`_. 

The code is open source, and `available on GitHub`_.
